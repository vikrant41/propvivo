      <p>A reserve fund is like a savings account set aside by the HOA to meet any unforeseen future costs or obligations for the upkeep of the community. Every HOA needs to decide the amount of reserve funds to be kept for the year, depending on the maintenance projects or any other issues. In addition to the planned expenditure, the HOA management also needs to have some additional money for unexpected costs. This gives the HOA a sense of stability and confidence, making it a very eligible community for new home buyers too.</p>

Here are some compelling reasons why reserve funding for HOA management is essential.</p>

    title: "Why Should Condominiums / HOA's Take Reserve Funding Seriously?",

      <p>Who needs to save for a rainy day? Everyone!</p>
      <p>A reserve fund is like a savings account set aside by the HOA to meet any unforeseen future costs or obligations for the upkeep of the community. Every HOA needs to decide the amount of reserve funds to be kept for the year, depending on the maintenance projects or any other issues. In addition to the planned expenditure, the HOA management also needs to have some additional money for unexpected costs. This gives the HOA a sense of stability and confidence, making it a very eligible community for new home buyers too.</p>
      <h4>Reserve Study A Necessity</h4>
      <p>Deciding on the amount to be set aside as reserves can be a daunting task for an HOA, especially if there are homeowners who are not ready to shell out additional money. It is therefore recommended to hire a property management company that can get the reserve study done on a yearly basis to analyze the repairs and replacements and get an approximation on the costs involved.</p>
      <h4>Benefits of Reserve Funds for an HOA</h4>
      <p>Every HOA should have some funds set aside to be used during emergencies. It not only helps cover sudden, unplanned expenditures but also allows the HOA Board Members to plan for the year much in advance. Here are some compelling reasons why <strong>reserve funding for HOA management</strong> is essential.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <h5>Lower dues and no special assessments</h5>
      <p>An HOA lacking an adequate reserve fund can face slack from homeowners as it could lead to a significant increase in dues and levying special assessments. Owners might not be able to afford a steep rise in contributions or be able to dole out lump sum money suddenly (as in the case of special assessment). However, with a reserve fund properly in place, repair and maintenance costs are deducted gradually as part of the dues.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h5>Aids in timely and proper upkeep of the HOA</h5>
      <p>Having an allocated reserve fund every year can help HOA management plan their yearly projects well in advance. This, in turn, would mean having ample time to find requisite vendors for the projects, negotiating on the price, and enhancing the look and feel of the community on the whole.</p></li>
      <li><h5>Keeping the law at bay</h5>
      <p>Planning for the future with proper reserve contributions is part of a board member’s fiduciary duty and failing to do so, in some states, can go against the law. Thus, it is mandated for the HOAs to have a requisite reserve fund after conducting a proper reserve study.</p></li>
      <li><h5>No requirement for loans</h5>
      <p><strong>Reserve funding for your HOA</strong> ensures that there are vital funds to take care of any unexpected expenditure. However, a lack of it can put the HOA in a difficult situation, compelling you to take bank loans to undertake necessary projects that were not planned in advance. A credit would increase the overall expenses for the HOA in the long run, as there would be a heavy interest involved. A reserve fund can be used as an essential financial and planning tool to aid HOA board members plan well for the future of the community without burdening the homeowners. Hence, it is a vital aspect of every HOA and should be catered for without a doubt.</p></li>

    title: "How to Measure the Value of Your Association Management Company?",

      <p>An association management company is hired by an HOA to ensure the needs of the community are well taken care of. The company is expected to undertake the tasks that the board members of an HOA would have otherwise done, including financials, repair works, grievances of homeowners, and more. However, how can you check if the HOA management company is carrying out the work they promised?</p>
      <p>Ways to measure the value of an association management company</p>
      <p>The valuation of an association management company is critical for the smooth functioning of the community. Here are 5 parameters that you should keep a keen eye on - </p>
    
      <ol>
 <li>
         <h5>Make a proper structure</h5>
         <ul>
           <li><h6>Documentation</h6>
           <p>You need to make a proper structure of the tasks assigned to the hired agency and in that, you and the other Board Members must list out the basic parameters to judge the performance and valuation of the management company. Here’s a suggestion and starting point.</p> </li>
           <li><h6>Discuss notes</h6>
           <p>Review the document with the association management company and discuss all the points in it to ensure that both parties agree upon what has been promised.</p> </li>
         </ul>
        </li>

        </li>

        <li><h5>Check deliverables</h5>
        <p>As an HOA member, check if the hired management company is completing all the deliverables that they planned on doing on a daily basis. If they can resolve issues of homeowners, if they undertake all the big tasks like repairs and maintenance, and also if they are doing what they are contracted to do so in an orderly manner. Make timelines of each task and check if they are being completed in the stipulated period. Ask for reports, they will definitely help you keep a check and look at the details.</p></li>

        <li><h5>Is the hired association management company current with laws and practices?</h5>
        <p>A good association management company should be clued-up about the current housing laws and practices of the state to help comply with the legal requirements. It’s best to check if the management company has the necessary certification in this field.</p></li>

        <li><h5>Response time for sorting out issues</h5>
        <p>An association management company is meant to resolve issues of homeowners at all times. They are hired for this precise task, so as part of the HOA, you should check if the hired company is able to provide the required and satisfactory support to the Board Members and Homeowners of your community. Regular feedback from the Members and Homeowners will help you understand the bigger picture.</p></li>

        <li><h5>Maintaining transparency</h5>
        <p>The association management company should have complete transparency in its dealings. All the finances and work undertaken should be clearly stated and shown to the HOA. This will lay the right foundation built with trust and will also help carry out the smooth functioning of the HOA.</p></li>


        </ol>
       

        <h4>Parting thoughts</h4>
        
        <p>These are some of the basic parameters of evaluating the working of the association management company. Look out for companies like Propvivo that leverage technology for such jobs as it brings in transparency, saves your time from day-to-day tasks, and it also allows the management company to focus on the more important tasks at hand.</p>
